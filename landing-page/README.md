# the greatest minds

# the project that I am really proud of.

## my sources

### the webinar in several things like : 1-the nav bar and how to make it, so basically the charts helped a lot seeing it made me know what to do 
### 2- the active class after the tutor tested the coorination then said that we should use the conditionals I started searching for it and thinking about how to make it(ofcourse sometimes we can make several answers but I had A SURPRISE exams at college so it kinda didn't give me time to search a lot, so really I am thankful for that webinar) 3-the remove all classes, basically the tutor said that we should start the active class by first removing all of the classes ...which was one class and last thing the webinar helped me is to know about the imediate working functions (function(){here code})() this saved my life because I don't have to worry about if i readded the function to execute or no (didn't always work for some reason but relly helped)

### second source is w3schools especially the HOW TO link (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp)
 ### the getBoundingClientReact source https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect.
 ### the get attribute source (helped in the syntax alot and know when to use it) - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getAttribute


##  the process of what I made 
### the nav bar list is made by making a list element and then making an anchor element(link) and then making the name of the link by the datanav(the nav part is replacable) and then making the link by fetching the ID and then make it as a variable and then add it to a '#' hashtag after that we append the anchor to the list and then we make a doc fragment to improve the performance (as it runs in  the background) then appending the lists to it and then appending the fragment to the NAVBAR. 

### then we removed the class that is there (youractiveclass) And yes I changed it because it wasn't working for some reason from your-active-class just to prepare for the getBoundingClientRect() part where I tested my screen saw the coordination and then added it in an if conditional (so what excatly happened is that I said get the variable where it fetched all of the sections and then made a loop for a function to happen that stated that if the the viewpoint is <this> this means the numbers, where the client is seeing it that way then add the class here and then when they don't see it,  remove the class (it became easier to know how to make the code after I removed the other class because it was working always,,,really thankful for the tutor's instructions).) 

## and the smooth scrolling (thx to tutor who gave me a clue on how to do it) I made it inside the loop while the navbar is being made. also just made a mediaquery to the css to make it responsive to the mobile phones according to the guidelines


# how to modify it 

### the constant name are:
### navSection(which fetchs all of the section elements (used for navigation bar and navigating in general))
### navID(which gets the ID of the parent where the dynamic nav bar exists)
### fragmentDoc (makes a fragmented document(helps in performance))
### makeList (makes a LI element) and the make link( makes anchor)
### function makingNavBarList (used to make the list that is also called as the top navigation bar)
### function removeCLass(used to remove a class)
### parameter viewedNow (means that whatever is viewed on the screen at the moment)
